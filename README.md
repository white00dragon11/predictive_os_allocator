# Predictive OS Resource Allocation

> A GUI-based Operating Systems project that uses predictive algorithms to optimize resource allocation and improve overall system efficiency.

## üîç Project Overview

This project simulates a smart OS-level resource allocator that **predicts process behavior** and intelligently assigns CPU, memory, and other system resources. The goal is to mimic real-world OS resource management strategies with a **focus on prediction-based optimization**.

Built as part of a university Operating Systems course, the system demonstrates:
- Predictive scheduling
- Smart resource allocation
- GUI-based interaction and visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- üß† **Prediction Logic**: Anticipates future resource needs based on historical data.
- üéõÔ∏è **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjusts resources on-the-fly to improve efficiency.
- üìä **GUI Dashboard**: Visual interface to display process queue, CPU usage, memory distribution, etc.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Simulation Mode**: Run custom process sets to observe performance.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** *(optional for graphs)*
- **Standard libraries** (threading, time, random)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/white00dragon11/predictive_os_allocator.git
   cd predictive_os_allocator

2. Run the application:
   python3 main.py


Make sure all required libraries are installed. If not, install them with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Future Improvements

    Add ML-based prediction (e.g., linear regression)

    More accurate simulation of IO-bound vs CPU-bound processes

    Add logs and analytics dashboard

    Export results to CSV/PDF
